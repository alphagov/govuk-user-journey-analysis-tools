    "# Reporting on user journeys to a GOV.UK page\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the count and proportion of sessions that have the same journey behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script finds sessions that visit a specific page (`DESIRED_PAGE`) in their journey. From the first or last visit to\n",
    "`DESIRED_PAGE` in the session, the journey is subsetted to include the last N pages including `DESIRED_PAGE`\n",
    "(`NUMBER_OF_STAGES`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The count and proportion of sessions visiting distinct, subsetted journeys are compiled together, and returned as a\n",
    "sorted list in descending order split by subsetted journeys including the entrance page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "- `START_DATE`: String in YYYYMMDD format defining the start date of your query.\n",
    "- `END_DATE`: String in YYYYMMDD format defining the end date of your query.\n",
    "- `DESIRED_PAGE`: String of the desired GOV.UK page path of interest. The string should only include the characters after www.gov.uk (e.g. '/browse/benefits')\n",
    "- `FIRST_HIT`: Boolean flag indicating that the `FIRST` hit to the `DESIRED_PAGE` in the session is used for the subsetted journey. If this option is selected, `LAST_HIT` cannot be selected. \n",
    "- `LAST_HIT`: Boolean flag indicating that the `LAST` hit to the `DESIRED_PAGE` in the session is used for the subsetted journey. If this option is selected, `LAST_HIT` cannot be selected.  \n",
    "- `NUMBER_OF_STAGES`: Integer defining how many pages in the past (including `DESIRED_PAGE`) should be considered when subsetting the user journeys. Note that journeys with fewer pages than `NUMBER_OF_STAGES` will always be included.\n",
    "- `PAGE_TYPE`: Boolean flag indicating that `PAGE` page paths are required. One of `PAGE_TYPE` or `EVENT_TYPE` must be selected.\n",
    "- `EVENT_TYPE`: Boolean flag indicating that `EVENT` page paths are required. One of `PAGE_TYPE` or `EVENT_TYPE` must be selected.\n",
    "- `DEVICE_DESKTOP`: Boolean flag indicating that desktop devices should be included in this query. One of `DEVICE_DESKTOP`, `DEVICE_MOBILE`, `DEVICE_TABLET`, or `DEVICE_ALL` must be selected. However, `DEVICE_TABLET` cannot be selected if `DEVICE_ALL` is selected.\n",
    "- `DEVICE_MOBILE`: Boolean flag indicating that mobile devices should be included in this query. One of `DEVICE_DESKTOP`, `DEVICE_MOBILE`, `DEVICE_TABLET`, or `DEVICE_ALL` must be selected. However, `DEVICE_MOBILE` cannot be selected if `DEVICE_ALL` is selected.\n",
    "- `DEVICE_TABLET`: Boolean flag indicating that tablet devices should be included in this query. One of `DEVICE_DESKTOP`, `DEVICE_MOBILE`, `DEVICE_TABLET`, or `DEVICE_ALL` must be selected. However, `DEVICE_TABLET` cannot be selected if `DEVICE_ALL` is selected.\n",
    "- `DEVICE_ALL`: Boolean flag indicating that all devices should be segmented but included in this query. One of `DEVICE_DESKTOP`, `DEVICE_MOBILE`, `DEVICE_TABLET`, or `DEVICE_ALL` must be selected. However, `DEVICE_ALL` cannot be selected if `DEVICE_DESKTOP`, `DEVICE_MOBILE`, or `DEVICE_TABLET` is selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "- `QUERY_STRING`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, remove query strings from all page paths. If `FALSE`, keep query strings in all page paths. \n",
    "- `FLAG_EVENTS`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, all `EVENT` page paths will have a ` [E]` suffix. This is useful if both `PAGE_TYPE` and `EVENT_TYPE` are selected, so you can differentiate between the same page path with different types. If `FALSE`, no suffix is appended to `EVENT` page paths.\n",
    "- `EVENT_CATEGORY`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, all event categorys will be displayed. \n",
    "- `EVENT_ACTION`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, all event actions will be displayed. \n",
    "- `EVENT_LABEL`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, all event labels will be displayed. \n",
    "- `ENTRANCE_PAGE`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, if the subsetted journey contains the entrance page this is flagged. \n",
    "- `REMOVE_DESIRED_PAGE_REFRESHES`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE` sequential page paths of the same type are removed when the query calculates the first/last visit to the desired page. In other words, it will only use the first visit in a series of sequential visits to desired page if they have the same type. Other visits to the desired page will remain, as will any other desired page refreshes.\n",
    "- `TRUNCATE_SEARCHES`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, all GOV.UK search page paths are truncated to `Sitesearch ({TYPE}): {KEYWORDS}`, where `{TYPE}` is the GOV.UK search content type, and `{KEYWORDS}` are the search keywords. If there are no keywords, this is set to `none`. If `FALSE`, GOV.UK search page paths are not truncated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "A csv file containing a Google BigQuery result showing the subsetted user journey containing `PAGE_TYPE` and/or `EVENT_TYPE` page paths in order from the first or last visit to `DESIRED_PAGE` with a maximum length `NUMBER_OF_STAGES`. The results are presented in descending order, with the most popular subsetted user journey first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results show:\n",
    "- `flagEntrance`: Subsetted journeys that incorporate the first page visited during a session are flagged if selected\n",
    "- `deviceCategories`: The device category/ies of the subsetted journeys\n",
    "- `totalSessions`: The total number of sessions\n",
    "- `countSessions`: The total number of sessions per subsetted journey\n",
    "- `proportionSessions`: The proportion of sessions per subsetted journey\n",
    "- `goalPreviousStepX`: The X previous page path following the `DESIRED_PAGE`; X corresponding to `NUMBER_OF_STAGES`\n",
    "- `goal`: The `DESIRED_PAGE`\n",
    "\n",
    "A second csv file showing the count for each previous step page path, regardless of the overall subsetted journey. The results are presented in descending order, with the most popular previous step first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Results show: \n",
    "- `goalPreviousStepX`: The X previous step page path; X corresponding to `NUMBER_OF_STAGES`\n",
    "- `countsGoalPreviousStepX`: The number of sessions that visited the page path at step X\n",
    "- `goal`: The `DESIRED_PAGE`\n",
    "- `countsGoal`: The number of unique subsetted journeys \n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only exact matches to `DESIRED_PAGE` are currently supported.\n",
    "- Other visits to `DESIRED_PAGE` are ignored, only the first or last visit is used.\n",
    "- If `REMOVE_DESIRED_PAGE_REFRESHES` is `TRUE`, and there is more than one page type (`PAGE_TYPE` and `EVENT_TYPE` are both selected), only the first visit in page refreshes to the same `DESIRED_PAGE` and page type are used to determine which is the first/last visit.\n",
    "- Journeys shorter than the number of desired stages (`NUMBER_OF_STAGES`) are always included.\n",
    "- GOV.UK search page paths are assumed to have the format `/search/{TYPE}?keywords={KEYWORDS}{...}`, where `{TYPE}` is the GOV.UK search content type, `{KEYWORDS}` are the search keywords, where each keyword is\n",
    "  separated by `+`, and `{...}` are any other parts of the search query that are not keyword-related (if they exist).\n",
    "- GOV.UK search page titles are assumed to have the format `{KEYWORDS} - {TYPE} - GOV.UK`, where `{TYPE}` is the GOV.UK search content type, and `{KEYWORDS}` are the search keywords.\n",
    "- If `ENTRANCE_PAGE` is `FALSE`, each journey (row) contains both instances where the entrance page is included, and the entrance page is not included. Therefore, if there are more page paths than `NUMBER_OF_STAGES`, this will not be flagged. \n",
    "- If `DEVICE_ALL` is selected in combination with either `DEVICE_DESKTOP`, `DEVICE_MOBILE`, and/or `DEVICE_TABLET`, then the analysis will use `DEVICE_ALL` and ignore all other arguments. "
