        "- `START_DATE`: String in YYYYMMDD format defining the start date of your query.\n",
        "- `END_DATE`: String in YYYYMMDD format defining the end date of your query.\n",
        "- `DESIRED_PAGE`: String of the desired GOV.UK page path of interest.\n",
        "- `FIRST_HIT`: Boolean flag indicating that the `FIRST` hit to the `DESIRED_PAGE` in the session is used for the subsetted journey. If this option is selected, `LAST_HIT` cannot be selected. \n",
        "- `LAST_HIT`: Boolean flag indicating that the `LAST` hit to the `DESIRED_PAGE` in the session is used for the subsetted journey. If this option is selected, `FIRST_HIT` cannot be selected.  \n",
        "- `NUMBER_OF_STAGES`: Integer defining how many pages in the past (including `DESIRED_PAGE`) should be considered when subsetting the user journeys. Note that journeys with fewer pages than `NUMBER_OF_STAGES` will always be included.\n",
        "- `PAGE_TYPE`: Boolean flag indicating that `PAGE` page paths are required. One of `PAGE_TYPE` or `EVENT_TYPE` must be selected.\n",
        "- `EVENT_TYPE`: Boolean flag indicating that `EVENT` page paths are required. One of `PAGE_TYPE` or `EVENT_TYPE` must be selected.\n",
        "- `DEVICE_DESKTOP`: Boolean flag indicating that desktop devices should be included in this query. One of `DEVICE_DESKTOP`, `DEVICE_MOBILE`, `DEVICE_TABLET`, or `DEVICE_ALL` must be selected. However, `DEVICE_TABLET` cannot be selected if `DEVICE_ALL` is selected.\n",
        "- `DEVICE_MOBILE`: Boolean flag indicating that mobile devices should be included in this query. One of `DEVICE_DESKTOP`, `DEVICE_MOBILE`, `DEVICE_TABLET`, or `DEVICE_ALL` must be selected. However, `DEVICE_MOBILE` cannot be selected if `DEVICE_ALL` is selected.\n",
        "- `DEVICE_TABLET`: Boolean flag indicating that tablet devices should be included in this query. One of `DEVICE_DESKTOP`, `DEVICE_MOBILE`, `DEVICE_TABLET`, or `DEVICE_ALL` must be selected. However, `DEVICE_TABLET` cannot be selected if `DEVICE_ALL` is selected.\n",
        "- `DEVICE_ALL`: Boolean flag indicating that all devices should be segmented but included in this query.

        "- `QUERY_STRING`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, remove query strings from all page paths. If `FALSE`, keep query strings in all page paths. \n",
        "- `FLAG_EVENTS`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, all `EVENT` page paths will have a ` [E]` suffix. This is useful if both `PAGE_TYPE` and `EVENT_TYPE` are selected, so you can differentiate between the same page path with different types. If `FALSE`, no suffix is appended to `EVENT` page paths.\n",
        "- `EVENT_CATEGORY`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, all event categorys will be displayed. \n",
        "- `EVENT_ACTION`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, all event actions will be displayed. \n",
        "- `EVENT_LABEL`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, all event labels will be displayed. \n",
        "- `ENTRANCE_PAGE`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, if the subsetted journey contains the entrance page this is flagged. \n",
        "- `EXIT_PAGE`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, if the subsetted journey contains the exit page this is flagged.  \n",
        "- `REMOVE_DESIRED_PAGE_REFRESHES`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE` sequential page paths of the same type are removed when the query calculates the first/last visit to the desired page. In other words, it will only use the first visit in a series of sequential visits to desired page if they have the same type. Other visits to the desired page will remain, as will any other desired page refreshes.\n",
        "- `TRUNCATE_SEARCHES`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, all GOV.UK search page paths are truncated to `Sitesearch ({TYPE}): {KEYWORDS}`, where `{TYPE}` is the GOV.UK search content type, and `{KEYWORDS}` are the search keywords. If there are no keywords, this is set to `none`. If `FALSE`, GOV.UK search page paths are not truncated.\n",

        "- If `ENTRANCE_PAGE` is `FALSE`, each journey (row) contains both instances where the entrance page is included, and the entrance page is not included. Therefore, if there are more page paths than `NUMBER_OF_STAGES`, this will not be flagged. \n",
