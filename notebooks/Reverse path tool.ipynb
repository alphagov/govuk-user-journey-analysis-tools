    "# Reporting on user journeys to a GOV.UK page\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the count and proportion of sessions that have the same journey behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script finds sessions that visit a specific page (`DESIRED_PAGE`) in their journey. From the last visit to\n",
    "`DESIRED_PAGE` in the session, the journey is subsetted to include the last N pages including `DESIRED_PAGE`\n",
    "(`NUMBER_OF_STAGES`). If the subsetted journey contains the entrance page this is flagged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The count and proportion of sessions visiting distinct, subsetted journeys are compiled together, and returned as a\n",
    "sorted list in descending order split by subsetted journeys including the entrance page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "- `START_DATE`: String in YYYYMMDD format defining the start date of your query.\n",
    "- `END_DATE`: String in YYYYMMDD format defining the end date of your query.\n",
    "- `DESIRED_PAGE`: String of the desired GOV.UK page path of interest.\n",
    "- `NUMBER_OF_STAGES`: Integer defining how many pages in the past (including `DESIRED_PAGE`) should be considered when subsetting the user journeys. Note that journeys with fewer pages than `NUMBER_OF_STAGES` will always be included.\n",
    "- `PAGE_TYPE`: Boolean flag indicating that `PAGE` page paths are required. One of `PAGE_TYPE` or `EVENT_TYPE` must be selected.\n",
    "- `EVENT_TYPE`: Boolean flag indicating that `EVENT` page paths are required. One of `PAGE_TYPE` or `EVENT_TYPE` must be selected.\n",
    "- `DEVICE_DESKTOP`: Boolean flag indicating that desktop devices should be included in this query. One of `DEVICE_DESKTOP`, `DEVICE_MOBILE`, or `DEVICE_TABLET` must be selected.\n",
    "- `DEVICE_MOBILE`: Boolean flag indicating that mobile devices should be included in this query. One of `DEVICE_DESKTOP`, `DEVICE_MOBILE`, or `DEVICE_TABLET` must be selected.\n",
    "- `DEVICE_TABLET`: Boolean flag indicating that tablet devices should be included in this query. One of `DEVICE_DESKTOP`, `DEVICE_MOBILE`, or `DEVICE_TABLET` must be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "- `FLAG_EVENTS`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, all `EVENT` page paths will have a ` [E]` suffix. This is useful if both `PAGE_TYPE` and `EVENT_TYPE` are selected, so you can differentiate between the same page path with different types. If `FALSE`, no suffix is appended to `EVENT` page paths.\n",
    "- `EVENT_CATEGORY`: Boolean flag indicating that the event category should be displayed in this query. \n",
    "- `EVENT_ACTION`: Boolean flag indicating that the event action should be displayed in this query. \n",
    "- `EVENT_LABEL`: Boolean flag indicating that the event label should be displayed in this query. \n",
    "- `REMOVE_DESIRED_PAGE_REFRESHES`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE` sequential page paths of the same type are removed when the query calculates the last visit to the desired page. In other words, it will only use the first visit in a series of sequential visits to desired page if they have the same type. Other earlier visits to the desired page will remain, as will any earlier desired page refreshes.\n",
    "- `TRUNCATE_SEARCHES`: Boolean flag. If `TRUE`, all GOV.UK search page paths are truncated to `Sitesearch ({TYPE}): {KEYWORDS}`, where `{TYPE}` is the GOV.UK search content type, and `{KEYWORDS}` are the search keywords. If there are no keywords, this is set to `none`. If `FALSE`, GOV.UK search page paths are not truncated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "A Google BigQuery result containing the subsetted user journey containing `PAGE_TYPE` and/or `EVENT_TYPE` page paths in reverse from the last visit to `DESIRED_PAGE` with a maximum length `NUMBER_OF_STAGES`. Counts and the proportion of sessions that have this subsetted journey are also shown. Subsetted journeys that incorporate the first page visited by a session are flagged as well. The results are presented in descending order, with the most popular subsetted user journey first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only exact matches to `DESIRED_PAGE` are currently supported.\n",
    "- Previous visits to `DESIRED_PAGE` are ignored, only the last visit is used.\n",
    "- If `REMOVE_DESIRED_PAGE_REFRESHES` is `TRUE`, only the first visit in a series of sequential visits (page refreshes) to `DESIRED_PAGE` are used to determine which is the last visit.\n",
    "- If `REMOVE_DESIRED_PAGE_REFRESHES` is `TRUE`, and there is more than one page type (`PAGE_TYPE` and `EVENT_TYPE` are both selected), only the first visit in page refreshes to the same `DESIRED_PAGE` and page type are used to determine which is the last visit.\n",
    "- Journeys shorter than the number of desired stages (`NUMBER_OF_STAGES`) are always included.\n",
    "- GOV.UK search page paths are assumed to have the format `/search/{TYPE}?keywords={KEYWORDS}{...}`, where `{TYPE}` is the GOV.UK search content type, `{KEYWORDS}` are the search keywords, where each keyword is\n",
    "  separated by `+`, and `{...}` are any other parts of the search query that are not keyword-related (if they exist).\n",
    "- GOV.UK search page titles are assumed to have the format `{KEYWORDS} - {TYPE} - GOV.UK`, where `{TYPE}` is the GOV.UK search content type, and `{KEYWORDS}` are the search keywords."
